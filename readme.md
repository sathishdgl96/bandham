<h1>Privacy Policy for Bandham</h1>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account information:</strong> phone/email (from sign in), UID, and basic identifiers from Firebase Authentication.</li>
  <li><strong>Profile information you provide:</strong> name, age, gender, community/caste, district/city, languages, and profile photo.</li>
  <li><strong>Content and activity:</strong> likes, passes, matches, chat metadata (summary, last message), and chat messages (stored in Firebase Realtime Database).</li>

  <li><strong>Purchase information:</strong> non-sensitive purchase tokens/transaction IDs related to Google Play Billing for credit purchases.</li>
  <li><strong>Device/usage data:</strong> basic app diagnostics, crash logs, and anonymized analytics or server logs necessary for operation and abuse prevention.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Optional collection</strong> (only if enabled in app settings and authorized by you):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google People API gender attribute to prefill your profile gender. This is used once during onboarding (if available) and you are informed in-app.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not collect precise location unless a feature explicitly requests it and you grant permission. As of this policy version, location is not required for core features.</p>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Operate and provide core features (profiles, explore, likes, matches, chat).</li>
  <li>Enforce safety, moderation, and platform integrity (e.g., photo moderation and abuse prevention).</li>
  <li>Provide credits and purchases (Google Play Billing), and optional rewarded-ad credits if ads are enabled.</li>
  <li>Improve reliability, troubleshoot issues, and protect against fraud and abuse.</li>
  <li>Communicate service updates, policy changes, and important notices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Bases (where applicable)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> to provide the Service you request.</li>
  <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to keep the Service safe and reliable.</li>
  <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where explicitly required (e.g., optional Google People API gender).</li>
  <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> to comply with applicable laws and requests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>We do not sell your personal information. We share information with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Service providers</strong> used to operate the Service, including:
    <ul>

      <li>Google Mobile Ads (only if ads are enabled)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Access/update:</strong> you can view and edit your profile in the app.</li>
  <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> you can request deletion using the in-app “Delete Account” option (or contact us). Deletion removes or anonymizes your personal information, subject to legal retention.</li>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including encryption in transit via HTTPS and Firebase security rules. No system is 100% secure; you are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials.</p>

<h2>International Transfers</h2>
<p>Your information may be processed on servers located outside your state or country (e.g., Firebase regions you select). We take steps to ensure appropriate protections consistent with applicable law.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
